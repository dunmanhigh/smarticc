Don't worry, technology may come and go, but some things never change. In the not-so-distant future, cars will drive themselves and men may become obsolete, but home will always be home. It'll just be a lot smarter.

Granted, some tech is better than other tech. No one needs a Wi-Fi-connected juice press that doesn't actually juice anything. Gadgets that offer real utility—like a smart oven or open source furniture—stand a better chance of becoming ubiquitous. If you're skeptical, think of it this way: In-home refrigeration was the crazy, newfangled invention of 1913. Now, few among us can imagine living without it.

What will the home of the future look like? We took stock of the most exciting tech-forward home products on the market. It's only a matter of time until at least some of these come standard in every home.

## Smart Cooking in the Kitchen

Ultimately, the goal of kitchen technology won't be to do the cooking for you. It'll just make you a better cook. Smart ovens such as those from June will be outfitted with cameras and digital thermometers, helping you monitor your food as it bakes. And instead of just hoping the “medium-hot” setting on your gas range is hot enough, smart skillets will take guessing out of the equation by sizzling food at a precise temperature, which you'll set on a connected app.
Smart refrigerators will help reduce waste by letting you know when the carrots in your fridge are about to go bad, and offer up several recipes for them to boot. The smart fridge from LG will even send cooking instructions to your smart oven. Meanwhile, 3D food printers will help you create intricately shaped pasta, and smart-technology-equipped ice cream makers will automatically sense the hardness of the mixture within and keep it ready until it's sundae time.

## Tech Enters the Bedroom

The latest wave of home-focused technology is about making everyday life better and easier, and that begins with a good night's sleep. Sleep trackers such as Eight's smart mattress and smartphone apps Sleep Time and Sleep Cyclewill use sensors to measure your sleep metrics, while smart alarm clocks like Amazon's mini Echo will help you begin your day on the right foot with time, weather, and news.
Once you're up and moving, it's time to get dressed: Your closet will be filled with clothes you don't just wear. They will actually interact with you, tracking health markers and habits. Among them: MadeWithGlove's still-in-development smart gloves, which promise to detect skin temperature and provide heat accordingly. Your clothes might even change shape or color based on your feelings, as will the Sensoree mood sweater.

## Disadvantages?
_Reliability_
A smart home will be extremely reliant on your internet connection. If your connection drops you'll be left with a lot of smart products that won't work. Additionally, wireless signals can possibly be interrupted by other electronics in your home and cause some of your smart products to function slowly or not at all.

_Slight Learning Curve_
Although most smart home systems are actually very easy to use, but at the same time there is still somewhat of a learning curve for most people. For anyone already immersed in technology, converting your smart home will be a breeze, but for anyone not so tech savvy, it may make for a lot of time spent reading manuals.
If you think you might have trouble learning how to use a smart home device, the answer may be simple. Ask for help! Asking someone to show you how to run your smart home can far less confusing than trying to make heads or tails of an instruction manual.

Sound far-fetched? Remember a decade ago, few of us could have imagined being so attached to our smartphones, let alone ordering groceries off the internet or barking commands at a digital assistant. With time, even the strangest things can become normal.
