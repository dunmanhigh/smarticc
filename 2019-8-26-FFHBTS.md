## **_WARNING: Contains spoilers_**

By now, we’re pretty sure that many of you would have seen _Spiderman: Far From Home_. But have you ever wondered how the movie creates many of its scenes?
Look at the picture below:

How many of you remember this scene from the movie? To jog your memory, this is when Peter Parker (Tom Holland) calls Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) to rescue him from the Netherlands. You must be thinking, a lot of effort must have been put in to find such a beautiful place to shoot this, and it must have also taken a lot of effort to find a plane for the shoot, right?

**WRONG!**

The picture below shows what the background looked like when they shot the scene:

Most of you must have been shocked at the vast difference between the two pictures. You must be wondering, how did the flowers and the jet appear then? Well, here is your answer: **CGI**.


## **What is CGI?**

CGI, also known as computer-generated imagery, is the application of computer graphics to create an image in many different forms of media, such as films, video games etc. Usually, CGI refers to 3D computer graphics there are used to create special effects in television shows and movies. In _Far From Home_, CGI is being used multiple times.


## **How is CGI used in _Far From Home_?**

For example, referring to the two pictures above, the tulip field in those scenes are completely CGI. They had to get the rows of the tulip fields neat and to put the two actors in places that make sense during the dialogue between the duo. They then proceeded to colour the tulips as well as manually carve each one, since no two flowers look exactly the same. They also needed to simulate a tulip field filled with wind motion as well as how they will move due to the landing of the jet. 

Another example is the outer space scene. Below is before (left) and after (right) CGI was implemented into the scene.

The CGI for _Far From Home_ had to do a detailed sketch of the Earth because it was not possible to convey a scale through an atmosphere. They also needed to let the viewers feel that the swarm of drones that came out of the satellite had some form of intelligence. Thus, they had to use some technology tricks to make it into the scene we know today.


## **Advantages and Disadvantages of Using CGI**

We feel that by using CGI, movie producers and directors do not need to find a certain location to fulfill certain elements of their preferred background for a certain scene in a movie. There is also no limit to how creative they can be, as long as they have enough money and time, they could practically do almost anything. CGI can be used to exaggerate scenes to enrapture the audience.

However, there are cons when using CGI. Some people might be so carried away since CGI is so useful, to the point when they still use CGI for simple scenes that can be done in reality, which causes them to waste time. Additionally, sometimes the CGI shots are put into a movie because the editors wants to show that they can do it, not because it adds to the storyline.
